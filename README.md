# Covid19vsFinance
In this repository, I am looking at some analysis on covid19 and its impact on the financial market.

It includes: 
1) Predictive analysis on new cases of Covid-19
2) Impact of the new cases on the global market (indices (SP500, DAX, Hang Seng, ...) specific)
3) Impact of Covid-19 related news (Reuters and Bloomberg) on the market - WebScrapping

These are used sofar by myself to make better investment decisions.
